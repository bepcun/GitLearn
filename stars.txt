This story is about stars. As you all know there are many stars. Sooo many stars. Sooo fucccking many stars. Very many of them glows on the sky every night. Unless there are clouds. Then you can't see a shit.

Let's assume though that there are no clouds and we can see stars. Neither is any other reason that might make stars invisible. In other words it's a great night for stars observation.

Do you have a telescope? Can you see something more with it, or just a regular shit - a glowing small bright dot?
